  utter_faq/side_effects:
  - text: "Mild-to-moderate side effects, like a low-grade fever or muscle aches, are normal and not a cause for alarm: they are signs that the body's immune system is responding to the vaccine, specifically the antigen (a substance that triggers an immune response), and is gearing up to fight the virus."

  utter_faq/chances_covid_after_vaccine:
  - text: "With COVID-19 shots reaching billions of people, reports have grown more common of people getting infected with the coronavirus despite being vaccinated. Just as a natural infection doesn't guarantee protection from reinfection with the virus, neither does immunization provide a perfect shield."

  utter_faq/get_vaccine_after_covid:
  - text: "However, no vaccine is 100% effective and, though rare, fully vaccinated people can contract coronavirus. These cases, known as breakthrough infections, can cause COVID-like symptoms — or no symptoms at all."

  utter_faq/test_positive_after_vaccine:
  - text: "No, the COVID-19 vaccine will not cause a positive test result for a COVID-19 PCR or antigen laboratory test. This is because the tests check for active disease and not whether an individual is immune or not."
